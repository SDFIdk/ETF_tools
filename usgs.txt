* LANDSAT_ETM_C1: 
    - abstract: Landsat 7 ETM+ images consist of eight spectral bands
                with a spatial resolution of 30 meters for bands 1 to
                7. The panchromatic band 8 has a resolution of 15
                meters. All bands can collect one of two gain settings
                (high or low) for increased radiometric sensitivity
                and dynamic range, while Band 6 collects both high and
                low gain for all scenes. Approximate scene size is 170
                km north-south by 183 km east-west (106 mi by 114 mi).

* LANDSAT_TM_C1: 
    - abstract: Landsat 4-5 TM image data files consist of seven
                spectral bands (See band designations). The resolution
                is 30 meters for bands 1 to 7. (Thermal infrared band
                6 was collected at 120 meters, but was resampled to 30
                meters.) The approximate scene size is 170 km north-
                south by 183 km east-west (106 mi by 114 mi).

* S2_MSI_L1C: 
    - abstract: The Level-1C product is composed of 100x100 km2 tiles
                (ortho-images in UTM/WGS84 projection). It results
                from using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to project
                the image in cartographic geometry. Per-pixel
                radiometric measurements are provided in Top Of
                Atmosphere (TOA) reflectances along with the
                parameters to transform them into radiances. Level-1C
                products are resampled with a constant Ground Sampling
                Distance (GSD) of 10, 20 and 60 meters depending on
                the native resolution of the different spectral bands.
                In Level-1C  products, pixel coordinates refer to the
                upper left corner of the pixel. Level-1C products will
                additionally include Cloud Masks and ECMWF data (total
                column of ozone, total column of water vapour and mean
                sea level pressure). SAFE formatted product, see
